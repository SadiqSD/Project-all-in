we have three switches with each having 3 LANS

FIRST VLAN  
vlan number 10
name of vlan Admin

SECOND VLAN 
vlan number 20
name of vlan Sales 

THIRD VLAN 
vlan number 30
name of vlan Accounting

the goal here is to make sure every lan can talk to it significant other in all 
of the three switches, even though there are in a defferent floor(we assign each switch in a imaginary
floor) in an organisiation.
Here you can see that the switches have three divices each connected
to it. which in every devices is connected to one of the vlan you will see i named every pc acconding
to the vlan is connected to for example a pc is connected to 
VLAN 10
the pc will be name pc 10.1 the 10 represent the number of vlan it's connected to while the .1
represent the switch is connected to 1,2,3 an so on the third .1 represent the number of pc connected to the seme vlan in
the switch, it might be morethan one or two.
you will notice that S1 (switch one) has four devices with two pc connected to one vlan marked in red
i will be using the color code for better understanding of the topology the
RED : stands for vlan 10
BLUE : stands for vlan 20
GREEN : stands for vlan 30

Here all the switch are configured and have most of there security features turned on
includig the port security, the console password, VTY and so on. Also an ip address are 
assingned to the vlans and the pc, the connection between the switches are configured to be 
trunk, you can cheack that with the show running-config command. in the intfaces
description you will see all the configuration done in the interface.

to do that i have a configuration txt file that i wrote at the time of configuration of the switches.
